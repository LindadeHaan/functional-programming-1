# OBA


## Proces 


### Week 1


#### Day 1 | 29 October 2018

Today started off with another kick-off by Titus and Laurens. Then ? gave us a short lecture about Oba and their house and technical rules. Followed by a lesson about higherfunctions, arrays and strings, which was very useful. Especially higherfunctions, because it allows you to write more readable code and a lot shorter. 

Then we tried to talk to the Oba API with an package from [Rijk van Zanten](https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/node-oba-api) on github, however it did not go as planned. Eventually we decided to put his code directly in to the [index.js](./index.js) file, because otherwise it did not work properly. I put the secret and public key into a .env file, because it cannot be published on github. .env is obviously stored in .gitignore. By importing .env into index.js you could access both keys. Right now I can only use different search words, which in turn will return matching results.
